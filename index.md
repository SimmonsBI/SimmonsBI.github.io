I’m an ecologist and conservationist who uses data science to understand and predict how biodiversity responds to global change and how best it can be conserved in the Anthropocene. Recently, I’ve been using networks, representing mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between species, to address these issues at the community scale.

Currently, I'm a [Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851](https://www.royalcommission1851.org) Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, working with [Christopher Kaiser-Bunbury](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Chris_Kaiser-Bunbury) on the effects of invasive species on plant-pollinator networks. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Sheffield, working with [Andrew Beckerman](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/beckerman) to understand the effects of multiple simultaneous stressors on food webs, and a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working with [William Sutherland](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/bill-sutherland) and [Lynn Dicks](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-lynn-dicks) on the structure and stability of mutualistic networks.
