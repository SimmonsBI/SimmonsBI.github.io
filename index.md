Iâ€™m an ecologist that studies complex ecological networks and develops new tools to do so. My research spans three main areas: understanding the responses of ecological networks to environmental and anthropogenic pressures; disentangling the determinants of network structure; and developing cutting-edge tools for ecological network analysis. 

Currently, I'm a Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851 Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, working with Christopher Kaiser-Bunbury on the effects of invasive species on plant-pollinator networks. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Sheffield, working with Andrew Beckerman to understand the effects of multiple simultaneous stressors on food webs, and a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working with William Sutherland and Lynn Dicks on the structure and stability of mutualistic networks.
