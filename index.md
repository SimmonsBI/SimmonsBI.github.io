Iâ€™m an ecologist who uses novel tools from computer science, data science and mathematics to understand and predict how ecological communities respond to global change and how best they can be conserved in the Anthropocene. I primarily do this through the lens of ecological networks, representing mutualistic or antagonistic interactions between species. 

Currently, I'm a [Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851](https://www.royalcommission1851.org) Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, working with [Christopher Kaiser-Bunbury](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Chris_Kaiser-Bunbury) on the effects of invasive species on plant-pollinator networks. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Sheffield, working with [Andrew Beckerman](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/beckerman) to understand the effects of multiple simultaneous stressors on food webs, and a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working with [William Sutherland](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/bill-sutherland) and [Lynn Dicks](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-lynn-dicks) on the structure and stability of mutualistic networks.
