I'm a [Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851](https://www.royalcommission1851.org) Research Fellow and proleptic Lecturer in Ecological Data Science at the University of Exeter. I’m an ecologist and conservationist who uses data science to understand and predict how biodiversity responds to global change and how best it can be conserved in the Anthropocene. I have broad interests, but some specific things I’m interested in at the moment include:

* Using networks as a tool to understand the structure and functioning of ecological communities and how they respond to stressors

* Using remote sensing data to answer questions at the landscape and global scales, such as looking at the resilience and stability of forest ecosystems

* Using data augmentation approaches to make camera traps and bioacoustic monitoring more feasible without the need for huge labelled datasets

If you’re interested in these topics, or anything else that combines data science and ecology or conservation, [get in touch](/contact).
