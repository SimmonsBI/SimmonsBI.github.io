Iâ€™m an ecologist who studies complex ecological networks and develops new tools to do so. My research spans three main areas: understanding the responses of ecological networks to environmental and anthropogenic pressures; disentangling the determinants of network structure; and developing cutting-edge tools for ecological network analysis. 

Currently, I'm a [Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851](https://www.royalcommission1851.org) Research Fellow at the University of Exeter, working with [Christopher Kaiser-Bunbury](https://biosciences.exeter.ac.uk/staff/profile/index.php?web_id=Chris_Kaiser-Bunbury) on the effects of invasive species on plant-pollinator networks. Previously, I was a postdoc at the University of Sheffield, working with [Andrew Beckerman](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/aps/staff-and-students/acadstaff/beckerman) to understand the effects of multiple simultaneous stressors on food webs, and a PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working with [William Sutherland](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/bill-sutherland) and [Lynn Dicks](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/dr-lynn-dicks) on the structure and stability of mutualistic networks.
