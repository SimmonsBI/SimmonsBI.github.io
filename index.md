I'm a [Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851](https://www.royalcommission1851.org) Research Fellow and proleptic Lecturer in Ecological Data Science at the University of Exeter. I’m an ecologist and conservationist who uses data science to understand and predict how biodiversity responds to global change and how best it can be conserved in the Anthropocene. I am broadly interested in solving problems at the interface of data science, ecology and conservation; a few specific things I’ve been working on recently can be found on my [research](/research) page, but this is by no means exhaustive.

If you’re interested in this kind of area and want to pursue Masters, PhD or postdoc work, [get in touch](/contact).
