### ECOLOGICAL FORECASTING

I am interested in using predictive approaches to answer conservation-relevant questions in community ecology. Currently I am working on methods to predict the structure of ecological networks and ecosystem function.

### THE EFFECTS OF STRESSORS ON ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS

I am interested in the effects of environmental and anthropogenic stressors – such as climate change, invasive species, pollution, and habitat loss and degradation – on the structure, dynamics and functioning of ecological networks. I am also interested in how network structure influences the robustness, resilience and stability of ecological networks. I tackle these questions using a variety of topological and dynamic network models which allow for realistic perturbations to be simulated, such as species extinctions or increased environmental fluctuations.

### UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESSES GOVERNING NETWORK STRUCTURE

I am interested in uncovering the factors influencing the observed structure of ecological networks. Not only does this provide insight into how communities assemble, but can also help predict the structure of novel communities under global changes. Projects in this theme include understanding the role of different structuring processes, such as morphological matching or neutral processes, and attempting to uncover the rules underlying network rewiring. 

### NEW TOOLS TO ANALYSE ECOLOGICAL NETWORKS

I develop new software tools to analyse ecological networks. Networks are structures that are very amenable to computational and mathematical analysis, and I create tools that enable new methods or reimplement existing methods in highly efficient ways. Further information about the tools I have developed can be found on the [software](/software) page.
